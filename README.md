# paulienuh; another repository.
Hi, I'm Pauline. My space on github is to show-case some of my web-design based project work from a range of university work and personal interest. <br>
Mostly working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP.

I also have a personal domain where I frequently blog. http://pawlean.com
