# paulienuh; another repository.
Hi, I'm Pauline. My space on github is to show-case some of my web-design based projects from a range of university projects and personal interest on web-development. <br>
Mostly working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP. 
<br><br>
I also have a personal domain where I frequently blog. http://pawlean.com
