<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse2" >
  Over the past twenty years, our understanding of the molecular machinery that
  drives intracellular transport and vesicle fusion has dramatically increased. For
  the majority of pathways, we now have a good understanding of which SNAREs
  are involved. However, it is less clear how post-Golgi SNAREs are trafficked to
  the correct compartments within the cell. My lab, in collaboration with others,
  has used a combination of biochemical approaches, trafficking assays and
  structural biology to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how R-SNAREs are
  packaged into transport vesicles. More recently, my lab has focused on
  elucidating how SNAREs lacking transmembrane domains are targeted to
  membranes. In particular, we are characterising the trafficking and function of
  the poorly characterised Q-SNAREs, SNAP29 and STX19. In my talk, I will
  discuss the mechanism involved in targeting SNAP29 and STX19 to tubular
  recycling endosomes and discuss the role of SNAP29 in post-Golgi trafficking.

  Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, subtypes, and mutants as tools in cell biology and for medical applications
</a>

<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse7">
  Botulinum neurotoxins comprise seven serologically distinguishable extremely potent toxins (BoNT/A to G). They enter nerve cells via endocytosis subsequent to binding gangliosides and synaptotagmin or SV2. Their catalytic domain (light chain, LC) acts after delivery in the cytosol as a zinc-endoprotease. BoNTs cleave specific members of the three SNARE protein families: VAMP/synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, or syntaxin. SNARE proteolysis inhibits fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane at the motoneuronal junction and thereby causes botulism.
However, for 25 years, BoNTs have served as effective pharmaceutical for the treatment of clinical conditions caused by hyperactivity of cholinergic nerve terminals. The range of their applications today includes neurons that innervate smooth muscles and glands as in overactive bladder and axillary hyperhidrosis. Further expansion of their application to therapeutically relevant hypersecretion of non-neuronal cells like mast cells and macrophages is prevented, as BoNTs do not readily cleave pertinent SNAREs like TI-VAMP/VAMP-7 and SNAP-23. Hence, re-engineering the known LCs is required in order that they can serve in diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma etc. We attempted to create LC/A with novel properties based on in-depth analysis of its substrate specificity and establishment of a model for its interaction with the virtually non-cleavable human SNAP-23. The results were exploited for re-engineering selected binding pockets in order to adapt the protease to human SNAP-23. To date, LC/A mutants obtained exhibit up to ten-fold increased activity to human SNAP-23. Combinations of individual mutants led to multiple mutants with yet higher activity to human SNAP-23.
The large number of recently detected new BoNT subtypes, to date >40, represents a reservoir for LC variants with potentially novel biochemical properties. Characterization of their substrate specificity is underway in various laboratories and might yield BoNTs exploitable in therapy and as new tool for cell biology studies.

  The anatomy and exocytic properties of astrocytic vesicles
</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse9">
  An important mode of intercellular communication involves the release of molecules from
  cells by exocytosis. Exocytotic transmitter release is most likely regulated by the SNARE
  complex, which contains a vesicular protein, synaptobrevin2 (Sb2). In this presentation our
  anatomical study of single vesicles in astrocytes, using super-resolution stimulated emission
  depletion (STED) microscopy and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) will be presented
  first. Smaller vesicles with diameters of ~65 nm contain amino acid and peptidergic
  transmitters and larger vesicles with diameters of ~230 nm contain ATP. By using photo
  bleaching experiments and fluorescence intensity analysis, we determined that an average
  astrocytic vesicle contains 15–25 endogenous Sb2 molecules. The density of Sb2 molecules
  appeared to be lower in larger vesicles. Moreover, the distribution of Sb2 molecules in
  vesicles is non-uniform and one YSpH molecule appeared necessary for fusion pore
  formation. In the second part of the lecture, the interaction of a single vesicle with the plasma
  membrane, monitored by a high-resolution membrane capacitance approach, will be
  presented. To determine unitary exocytotic event properties, reflecting the interaction of a
  single vesicle with the plasma membrane, discrete increases in membrane capacitance,
  revealed that astrocyte stimulation increases the frequency of predominantly transient fusion
  exocytotic events in smaller vesicles, whereas larger vesicles proceed more likely to full
  fusion exocytosis. To determine whether this reflects a lower density of SNARE proteins in larger vesicles,
  we treated astrocytes with botulinum neurotoxins D and E, which reduced
  exocytotic events regardless of their size. dnSNARE peptide, coding the cytoplasmic domain
  of Sb2, stabilized the fusion-pore diameter to narrow, release-unproductive diameters in both
  vesicle types, regardless of vesicle diameter. These experiments revealed two functional
  types of vesicles in astrocytes that contain distinct gliosignaling molecules. Given the
  slowness of regulated exocytosis in astrocytes and the targeting of slow cortical activity
  associated with dnSNARE expression in vivo, the behavioral phenotype resulting from
  inhibiting vesicular release is likely mainly associated with impaired release from larger
  vesicles containing ATP.

  UNC-18 and Tomosyn antagonistically act in parallel to control synaptic vesicle priming downstream of UNC-13.
</a>

<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse11" >
  Munc18-1/UNC-18 is believed to prime SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, yet the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we examined how potential gain-of-function mutations of Munc18-1/UNC-18 affect locomotory behavior and synaptic transmission, and how Munc18-1-mediated priming is related to Munc13-1/UNC-13 and Tomosyn, positive and negative SNARE regulators, respectively. We show that a Munc18-1(P335A)/UNC-18(P334A) mutation leads to significantly increased locomotory activity and acetylcholine release in C. elegans, and increased synaptic neurotransmission in cultured mammalian neurons. Importantly, similar to tom-1 null mutants, the unc-18(P334A) mutation partially bypasses the requirement of UNC-13. Moreover, unc-18(P334A) and tom-1 null mutations exhibit a strong synergy in suppressing unc-13 mutant defects. Biochemically, Munc18-1(P335A) exhibits enhanced activity in SNARE complex formation as well as increased binding to the preformed SNARE complex, and partially bypasses the Munc13-1 requirement in liposome fusion assays. Our results indicate that Munc18-1/UNC-18 primes vesicle fusion downstream of Munc13-1/UNC-13 by templating SNARE complex assembly and acts in parallel with Tomosyn, which inhibits exocytosis.

<td><a href="#collapse13" data-toggle="collapse" >On the involvement of synatotagmins and SNAREs in vesicle priming and fusion.</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse13" >
Regulated exocytosis involves several steps, including vesicle priming and fusion triggering. Priming is the process that makes the vesicle release-competent, and it was shown to be Ca2+-dependent in the sub-M range 25 years ago. Molecularly, it involves the assembly of the N-terminal end of the SNARE-complex between vesicle and plasma membrane with the help of Munc18 and Munc13 isoforms. Fusion triggering is also Ca2+-dependent (in the several-M range), and it requires Ca2+-binding to synaptotagmins (in chromaffin cells synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7), and is assisted by the cytosolic protein complexin.
  I am going to discuss two questions. First: how is priming made Ca2+-dependent? Ca2+-dependent priming in chromaffin cells potentially allows circulating hormones that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (e.g. histamine), to increase primed vesicle pool size, and act synergistically with neuronal stimulation to boost release . We have found that when present alone synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7 both act autonomously in exocytosis triggering, with synaptotagmin-1 being the faster sensor. However, when present together, synaptotagmin-7 and synaptotagmin-1 take over different functions: synaptotagmin-7 now acts to decrease unpriming (the opposite reaction to priming), whereas synaptotagmin-1 acts to trigger fast release. I will discuss how these different functions might result from isoform competition in the presence of a conserved mechanism for synaptotagmin action.
  The second question is: what is the nature of the interaction between the SNAREs and synaptotagmins, which makes fusion Ca2+-dependent? This involves experiments performed in autaptic glutamatergic neurons. Using mutagenesis, we find that fusion triggering is limited by an electrostatic energy barrier, which is influenced by charges on the outside of the SNARE-bundle. This energy barrier for release is increased in amplitude by negative charges and decreased by positive charges. This makes it possible for Ca2+ to trigger release in a fraction of a millisecond by throwing an electrostatic switch.

  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse21" >
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is essential for exocytosis, the Ca2+-dependent fusion of intracellular vesicles with the plasma membrane. This process underlies chemical synaptic transmission and release of water-soluble hormones from endocrine cells. Classical ways of manipulating PI(4,5)P2 levels are slower than the rate of PI(4,5)P2 metabolism, making it hard to tease the roles of PI(4,5)P2 apart from those of its metabolites, including diacylglycerol (DAG), or other phosphatidylinositols. Here, we develop a membrane-permeant, photoactivatable PI(4,5)P2, which can be loaded into cells in an inactive form and rapidly activated by light, allowing sub-second specific increases in PI(4,5)P2 levels. By combining this compound with genetic manipulations and electrophysiological measurements in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells, we identify synaptotagmin-1 (the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis) and Munc13-2 (a vesicle priming protein) as essential PI(4,5)P2 effectors for exocytosis in live cells. Strikingly, uncaging of PI(4,5)P2 but not of DAG triggered the rapid fusion of a subset of readily-releasable vesicles, revealing a rapid role of PI(4,5)P2 in secretion triggering. Thus, optical uncaging of signaling lipids can uncover their direct and rapid effects on cellular processes and identify lipid effectors.

  MicroRNA exocytosis by vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse27" >Neurotransmitters and peptide hormones are secreted into outside the cell by a vesicle fusion process. Although non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that include microRNA (miRNA) regulates gene expression inside the cell where they are transcribed, extracellular miRNA has been recently discovered outside the cells, proposing that miRNA might be released to participate in celltocell communication. Despite its importance of extracellular miRNA, the molecular mechanisms by which miRNA can be stored in vesicles and released by vesicle fusion remain enigmatic. Using next-generation sequencing, vesicle purification techniques, and synthetic neurotransmission, we observe that large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) contain a variety of miRNAs including miR-375. Furthermore, miRNA exocytosis is mediated by the SNARE complex and accelerated by Ca2+. Our results suggest that miRNA can be a novel neuromodulator that can be stored in vesicles and released by vesicle fusion together with classical neurotransmitters.

  Role of Neuropilin-1 in Chromogranin A-mediated regulation of Angiogenesis and tumor growth</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse29" >
We have previously shown that full-length chromogranin A (CgA1-439), a secretory protein released in circulation by the neuroendocrine system, can inhibit angiogenesis, whereas the truncated form CgA1-373 is pro-angiogenic. CgA1-439 and CgA1-373 are released in variable amounts in the blood of cancer patients. We investigated the receptor mechanisms underlying the CgA1-373 pro-angiogenic activity. In vitro biochemical studies showed that CgA1-373 can bind to neuropilin-1. Structure function studies showed that the neuropilin-1 binding site is located in the truncated C-terminal region of the CgA1-373 (CgA368-373: GPGPQLR) and that R373 is crucial for the binding. In vitro angiogenesis assays showed that the pro-angiogenic activity of CgA1-373 could be inhibited by antibodies against neuropilin-1, and by antibodies against the GPGPQLR truncated epitope of CgA1-373, pointing to a crucial role of this receptor. The pro-angiogenic activity of CgA1-373 was also inhibited by anti-VEGF and anti-FGF-2 antibodies. In vivo studies showed that antibodies against the GPGPQLR site of CgA1-373, which is formed during tumor progression, can reduce tumor perfusion and growth, suggesting that CgA fragmentation and interaction with neuropilin-1 is crucial for tumor angiogenesis and progression. Finally, we found the C-terminal residue R373, crucial for binding, is rapidly cleaved to generate CgA1-372, with consequent loss of neuropilin-1 binding and gain of potent anti-angiogenic activity. Overall, these results suggest that cleavage of CgA at the R373R374 dibasic site in tumors and the subsequent removal of R373 in plasma represents an important “off/on/off” switch for the regulation of angiogenesis in tumors, thereby representing a novel therapeutic target.

  Catestatin Inhibits obesity-induced macrophage infiltration and inflammation in the liver and suppresses hepatic glucose production leading to improved insulin sensitivity
</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse31" >
Macrophages (MΦs), one of the cells of the innate immune system, reside in or infiltrate metabolic organs under obese conditions and contribute to low-grade inflammation that impairs insulin action, leading to the development of insulin resistance.  MΦs play crucial roles in hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance as supported by improvement in insulin sensitivity after chemical deletion or genetic impairment of hepatic MΦs. Here, we have investigated the role of chromogranin A (CgA) peptide catestatin (CST) in regulation of MΦ function and the consequent improvement in insulin action.
  The activation of resident Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte (Mc)-derived recruited macrophages (McMΦs) in the liver contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. FACS-sorted F4/80+Ly6C- cells (representing KCs) and F4/80-Ly6C+ cells (representing McMΦs) revealed increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio in McMΦs compared to KCs. Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice treated with catestatin (CST) inhibited the infiltration of McMΦs, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes in MΦs, resulting in improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance in DIO mice. Systemic CST knockout (CST-KO) mice on normal chow diet (NCD) ate more food, gained weight, and displayed elevated blood glucose and insulin levels. Supplementation of CST normalized glucose and insulin levels. In order to verify that CST deficiency caused macrophages to be very pro-inflammatory in CST-KO mice (even being under NCD) and produced glucose intolerance, we tested the effects of MΦs on hepatic glucose production (HGP). Both basal and glucagon-induced HGP was markedly increased in hepatocytes co-cultured with KCs and McMΦs from NCD-fed CST-KO mice, and the effect was abrogated upon pre-treatment of CST-KO-MΦs with CST.
  The above findings provide a novel mechanism of HGP suppression through CST-mediated inhibition of macrophage infiltration and function and the consequent improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity.

<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse33" >
  Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Hypercholesterolemia (HC) are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity
  and mortality and DM often leads to diabetic polyneuropathy (PNP) which represents the leading cause of non-
  traumatic amputation. Secretoneurin (SN) is an angiogenic neuropeptide and SN gene therapy exerts positive
  effects in animal models of hindlimb and myocardial ischemia.
  Gene therapy trials with angiogenic cytokines most often were performed in healthy animals whereas
  cardiovascular patients usually have several risk factors like DM or HC, which might impair vascular response.
  We therefore investigated the effects of SN gene therapy in hindlimb ischemia models of DM (streptozotocin-
  induced DM) and HC (Apo E knock out mouse). In both models of impaired vascular response SN gene therapy
  improved blood perfusion and induced angiogenesis. SN also exerted positive effects on endothelial cells
  exposed to high glucose or oxidized LDL. These data indicate that SN gene therapy also is effective in animal
  models associated with prominent vascular risk factors.
  We also investigated the effects of SN gene therapy on diabetic PNP in the db/db knock out mouse. These mice
  are a known animal model for PNP and SN gene therapy improved diminished nerve function as shown by nerve
  conduction velocity studies and the tailflick test. SN also increased the density of vasa nervorum in diabetic
  nerves consistent with angiogenesis in vasa nervorum. SN additionally stimulated proliferation of Schwann cells
  indicating positive effects on these cells.
  In summary, SN gene therapy exerted beneficial effects on angiogenesis in animal models of high vascular risk
  like DM and HC.

  The exocytotic fusion pore formed by the neuronal SNARE complex</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse37">
  The neuronal SNARE complex, which in mammalian neurosecretory cells is composed of the vSNARE synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2), and the tSNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP25, plays a key role in vesicle fusion. However, in spite of an enormous body of research the molecular mechanism of fusion pore formation and the structure of the fusion pore are still not clear.
    In individual chromaffin cells, we tracked conformational changes in SNAP25 by total internal reflection FRET microscopy while exocytotic catecholamine release from single vesicles was simultaneously recorded using a microfabricated electrochemical detector array. A local rapid and transient FRET change lasting ~5 s occurred precisely where individual vesicles released catecholamine. The FRET change was abrupt and preceded the opening of an exocytotic fusion pore by ~60-90 ms. A similar transient FRET change can be stimulated by pulse depolarization, coincides with the [Ca2+] change and requires the v-SNARE. The results indicate that the Ca2+ signal induces a rapid conformational change in the SNARE complex, followed by fusion with a delay that may depend on [Ca2+].
    Experiments with Syb2 transmembrane domain mutations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support the hypothesis that in neurosecretory cells, fusion pore formation is directly accomplished by a conformational change in the SNARE complex via movement of the transmembrane domains. Coarse Grained MD simulations of SNARE protein mediated fusion pore formation between a nanodisc and a planar membrane, revealed formation of proteolipid fusion pores. Estimates of the conductances of these fusion pores are in excellent agreement with experimentally measured early fusion pore conductances. Combining ion substitution and amperometry as well as MD simulations indicate that fusion pores <~200 pS are cation selective and become non-selective as the fusion pore expands. The results suggesting that the fusion pore structures evolving in these simulations reflect the molecular structure of exocytotic fusion pores.

  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse41">
Exocytosis proceeds through an intermediate state in which a narrow fusion pore connects the secretory vesicle lumen with the extracellular environment. Small molecules such as nucleotides can escape through the fusion pore, while larger peptide hormones such as insulin remain trapped and require pore expansion for release. There is evidence that pore restriction/expansion is a regulated process involving Ca2+ and the GTPase dynamin. We have studied fusion pore expansion in insulin secreting beta-cells using high resolution imaging, by exploiting the luminal pH switch that occurs just after pore opening. I will present recent data detailing the mechanism by which cAMP dependent hormone action affects pore expansion, as well as a results from a systematic screen of proteins involved in exo- and endocytosis where we asked whether expression of certain proteins affect fusion pore behavior and whether they are present at the site of restricted pores. The data have implications for the understanding of two major antidiabetic drugs and certain genetic alleles that increase the risk for development of type-2 diabetes.

  Secretory granule heterogeneity and the regulation of calcium-triggered exocytosis.</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse45">
Adrenomedullary chromaffin cells respond to sympathetic nervous system activation by secreting a cocktail of potent neuropeptides and hormones into the circulation. The distinct phases of the chromaffin cell secretory response have been attributed to the progressive fusion of distinct populations of dense core granules with different activation kinetics. However, it has been difficult to define what distinguishes these populations at the molecular level. Functional segregation of granule pools may depend on selective sorting of synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7), which our previous work showed are rarely cosorted to the same granule. Here we assess the consequences of selective sorting of Syt isoforms in chromaffin cells, particularly with respect
to granule dynamics and activation kinetics. Upon depolarization of cells expressing fluorescent Syt isoforms using elevated K+, we find that Syt-7 granules fuse with faster kinetics than Syt-1 granules, irrespective of stimulation
strength. Pharmacological blockade of Ca2+ channels reveals differential dependence of Syt-1 versus Syt-7 granule exocytosis on Ca2+ channel subtypes. Syt-7 granules also show a greater tendency to fuse in clusters than
Syt-1 granules, and granules harboring Syt-1 travel a greater distance before fusion than those with Syt-7, suggesting that there is spatial and fusion-site heterogeneity among the two granule populations. However, the
greatest functional difference between granule populations is their responsiveness to Ca2+. Upon introduction of Ca2+ into permeabilized cells, Syt-7 granules fuse with fast kinetics and high efficacy, even at low Ca2+ levels (e.g.,
when cells are weakly stimulated). Conversely, Syt-1 granules require a comparatively larger increase in intracellular Ca2+ for activation. At Ca2+ concentrations above 30 μM, activation kinetics are faster for Syt-1 granules than for Syt-7 granules. Our study provides evidence for functional specialization of chromaffin cell granules via selective expression of Syt isoforms with different Ca2+ sensitivities.

  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse47">
  Secretory vesicle docking, priming, and Ca2+-triggered fusion are orchestrated by a complex and highly conserved molecular machinery. Despite the similarities in the composition of the release machinery between different neurosecretory systems, their functional and morphological characteristics can differ dramatically, for example, with respect to the ultrastructural architecture of release sites and transmitter release properties. The accurate assessment of vesicle docking requires electron microscopy to resolve inter-membrane distances in the nm range, but information on proteins involved in this process has been partly inconclusive. Important reasons for experimental inconsistencies are that diverse preparations, cell types, sample fixation methods, imaging approaches, and docking definitions have been employed. Combining organotypic slice cultures from mice lacking key proteins of the release machinery, rapid cryofixation, freeze substitution, and 3D-electron tomography of hippocampal spine synapses, we found that synaptic vesicle (SV) docking requires Munc13 proteins and all three neuronal SNAREs (SNAP-25, Synaptobrevin-2, Syntaxin-1), but not necessarily Synaptotagmin (Syt)-1. Our data indicate that morphologically docked SVs comprise the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of primed SVs and loss of Munc13 and SNARE proteins cause an accumulation of SVs in close-distance of the membrane that are possibly “tethered” to the active zone. However, loss of Munc13 proteins in chromaffin cells had no effect on large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) docking despite a severe reduction in the functional RRP. Similarly, loss of the neuronal SNAREs SNAP-25 and Synaptobrevin-2 did not alter LDCV docking, indicating that the majority of docked LDCVs in chromaffin cells are not fusion-competent and that we may not be able to morphologically distinguish the functional RRP in this neurosecretory system. Interestingly, we further dissected two distinct pools of “docked” and “tethered” LDCVs within 40 nm of the membrane in all genotypes analysed, highlighting the need for high-resolution 3D-electron microscopy approaches to accurately assess LDCV docking in chromaffin cells.

  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse49">In the early 70s, two models for synaptic vesicle endocytosis were put forward based on the ultrastructural studies of frog neuromuscular junctions. Heuser and Reese found that vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane and synaptic vesicles are recovered via slow, clathrin-mediated endodcytosis. Ceccarelli and his colleagues observed a fusing vesicle with a narrow neck and deduced that vesicles do not fully collapse into the membrane and that vesicles are recovered thorough a rapid reversal of the fusion pore. Since then, conflicting evidence has accumulated: the molecular studies suggest that clathrin and clathrin-associated proteins are essential, but the kinetics studies have indicated the existence of both fast and slow mechanisms.
	The major criticism of the original morphological studies was that they used intense stimulation to ensure the capture of endocytic events. To determine how endocytosis takes place after a single action potential, we coupled channelrhodopsin-induced synaptic transmission with rapid high-pressure freezing and captured membrane dynamics following fusion of synaptic vesicles.  We found that vesicle membrane is retrieved within 100 ms after fusion in mouse hippocampal neurons. This ultrafast endocytic pathway is compensatory – the amount of membrane retrieved equals the amount of membrane exocytosed. Following ultrafast endocytosis, large endocytic vesicles are delivered to endosomes. Synaptic vesicles are then regenerated from the endosomes ~5 s after stimulation. The newly formed vesicles return to active zone, suggesting that these vesicles are functional synaptic vesicles.
	To test the requirement for clathrin, we generated shRNA against clathrin heavy chain. We found that ultrafast endocytosis is intact in the clathrin knock-down cells. However, synaptic endosomes were not resolved into synaptic vesicles, suggesting that clathrin is required for regenerating vesicles from endosomes. These results suggest that regeneration of synaptic vesicles is a two-step process: rapid, clathrin-independent internalization of vesicle membrane followed by slower, clathrin-dependent reconstitution of vesicles.

    Our laboratory is interested in membrane fusion and fission mediated by dynamin and other dynamin-like proteins.  We are currently focusing on dynamin and its role in endocytosis.  The approach we are taking is to examine the structure and function of proteins involved in these processes by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and biochemical methods. In addition to examining the gross morphology of protein complexes, we have solved the 3-dimensional structure of several dynamin family members by image processing methods. We currently have a 4.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the constricted, membrane-associated helical polymer of human dynamin-1 in the GTP bound state. Compared to the soluble tetramer, the membrane-associated dynamin adopts a more extended conformation. In addition, our new model fits well into the cryo-EM map of a constricted, membrane-free spiral, suggesting membrane is dispensable for stabilizing the constricted conformation. The model also fits well into the map of a super-constricted polymer, confirming that the new interfaces are sufficient to bring the lipid bilayer close enough for spontaneous fission. The new reconstruction also allows unambiguous placement of dynamin’s membrane-binding pleckstrin homology domain, which has been poorly defined in previous models due to flexibility.  Overall, our new structure, in combination with previous 3D reconstructions in different nucleotide states, capture conformational changes in the polymer that ultimately leads to membrane fission.

  Syntaxin1A is a key protein involved in mediating synaptic transmission through its ability to form the SNARE complex with cognate partners – SNAP-25 and VAMP2. Syntaxin1A molecules on the plasma membrane of neuro-secretory cells are organized in nano-clusters, which have been shown to play an important role in docking and priming of secretory vesicles.  How individual molecules of Syntaxin1A enter and exit these nano-clusters by lateral diffusion and how stimulation affects their dynamic equilibrium at the pre-synapse in vivo in unknown. To image single molecules of Syntaxin1A in live synapses, we generated a Drosophila line constitutively expressing photo-convertible fluorescently tagged Syntaxin1A (Sx1A-mEos2) to carry out single particle tracking Photoactivated Localization Microscopy on live Drosophila larva neuromuscular junction. We investigated the change in Syntaxin1A mobility and nano-domain organization elicited by increased pre-synaptic activity using both opto-genetic and thermo-genetic tools. Here, we show that in Drosophila larva motor nerve terminals, the overall mobility of Syntaxin1A molecules was low and raising synaptic activity led to an increase in Syntaxin1A mobility. This suggested that a significant proportion of Syntaxin1A molecules are pre-engaged in the SNARE complex, which confer such relatively low mobility. Indeed, concomitant expression of tetanus toxin light chain, which prevents SNARE complex assembly, significantly increased Syntaxin1A mobility, but opposing effect on Syntaxin1A mobility was observed when SNARE complex disassembly was prevented by the temperature sensitive NSF mutation. Decreasing Syntaxin1A interaction with polyphosphoinositides abrogated the activity-dependent increase in mobility. Our results suggest that the relative immobility of Syntaxin1A molecules within synapses is indicative of a high level of primed vesicles in live motor nerve terminals.

  Doc2B acts as a calcium sensor for vesicle priming requiring  synaptotagmin-1, Munc13-2 and SNAREs</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse55">
Doc2B is a cytosolic protein with two C2-domains that bind to membranes, Ca2+ and SNAREs, and with further binding sites for Munc13 and the dynein light-chain Tctex-1. The function of Doc2B as a calcium sensor akin to synaptotagmins, and its involvement in different phases of release, is under debate. Here, we employed mutational analysis of candidate Doc2b interaction partners, combined with membrane capacitance measurements and carbon-fiber amperometry to dissect the role of Doc2B in neuroendocrine cells.
    In mouse adrenal chromaffin cells both the fast and slow bursts of release were reduced in the absence of Doc2B, whereas release during sustained calcium elevations was potentiated. Cross-rescue experiments showed that Doc2B does not substitute for the two main Ca2+ sensors for release: synaptotagmin-1 and -7. Substitution of the Ca2+-coordinating aspartates with asparagine (C2A-domain DN mutation) or alanine (C2A/B-domain 6A mutation) blocked Ca2+-dependent Doc2B translocation, and rendered vesicle priming Ca2+-independent.  Mutations designed to interfere with SNARE (KE mutant), or Munc13 (mutation: N-terminal part of the MID-domain) interaction blocked the stimulation of priming, and so did the elimination of ubMunc13-2 or synaptotagmin-1. Mutation of the Tctex-binding site had only subtle effects. None of those mutations affected the function of Doc2B in inhibiting sustained release. However, deleting the entire MID domain (MID, aa 14-41) relieved the inhibitory effect, but inhibition persisted in the absence of ubMunc13-2.
    Overall, we conclude that Doc2B acts as a calcium-dependent priming factor, and that the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of Doc2B involve overlapping sequences near the MID-domain, pointing to a complex interaction with the release machinery.

  Imaging live synaptic vesicles by subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules (sdTIM).</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse57">
    While the resolution of conventional optical microscopy is diffraction-limited, isolated light-emitting molecules can be localized within a far smaller volume using nanoscopic methods. Advances in imaging methodologies have provided crucial information on neuronal endocytic pathways, increasing our understanding of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling, synaptic activity, neuronal survival and homeostasis. One of the main limitations of the current super-resolution technologies for direct visualization of SVs in presynapses is their limited ability to track multiple vesicles simultaneously which dramatically restrict the dissection of SV discrete diffusional and transport states. To address this, we implemented a novel pulse-chase technique based on the subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules (sdTIM). The technique allowed us to image anti-green fluorescent protein Atto647N-tagged nanobodies trapped in SVs from live hippocampal nerve terminals expressing vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)–pHluorin (Joensuu et al., JCB 2016). We have further extended our protocol for sequential dual-colour super-resolution imaging of Atto565-tagged nanobodies and Alexa647-tagged cholera toxin subunit-B internalized in SVs and signalling endosomes, respectively, undergoing long-range axonal retrograde transport with 30-50 nm localization precision (Joensuu et al., Nat. Protocols in press). Our results showed that, once internalized, VAMP2-pHluorin/Atto647N-tagged nanobodies exhibited a markedly lower mobility than on the plasma membrane, an effect that was reversed upon restimulation in presynapses but not in neighbouring axons. Combining sdTIM with Bayesian model selection applied to hidden Markov modelling, allows determining both (i) the number of active transport and diffusive states underlying a particular particle trajectory, and (ii) when transitions between these states occur. Our results showed that SVs oscillate between diffusive states, or a combination of diffusive and transport states with opposite directionality. Importantly, SVs exhibiting diffusive motion were less likely to switch to the transport motion. sdTIM technique offers a transferable approach to track additional subdiffractional endocytic structures in live neurons and other cell types.

  Fluorescent intra-body localization Microscopy (FiLM):  A novel method for tracking single intracellular endogenous and GFP-tagged proteins in vitro and in vivo
</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse59">
  By breaking the Abbe law of diffraction, super-resolution microscopy techniques provide unprecedented detail of biological structures and processes. However, the requirement for fluorescent photoconvertible tags has hampered progress and exposed PALM and sptPALM techniques to over-expression artifacts, raising the need for developing novel tools to bypass these limitations.   Herein, we describe the development of single chain expressed in cells as ‘intra-nanobodies’ to perform single molecule imaging of any GFP-tagged or endogenous intracellular proteins.
    Configuration 1: Co-expression of a GFP binding nanobody tagged with a photoconvertible mEOS2 to image any GFP-tagged protein in cells. We co-expressed anti GFP-intra-nanobody-mEos with PH-PLCδ-GFP allowed super-resolution imaging of phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate nanodomains in fixed and live neurosecretory PC12 cells. We found identical domain size and mobility when using PH-PLCδ-mEos2. Further, combining the intra-nanobody with an Apex tag allowed us to perform 3D electron microscopy on these nanodomains. Using the same technique, we visualized cell-cell junctions at nanoscale in genetically modified CACO2 cell line expressing GFP tagged E-cadherin at endogenous levels. Expressing the GFP intra-nanobody, within the nematode C. elegans PLM mechanosensory neurons, allowed us to visualize the fusogen protein EFF-1 at nanoscale in vivo.  In addition, using zebrafish D. rerio expressing the GFP intra-nanobody, we were able to visualize Cavin 1 within its muscle fibers.
    Configuration 2: Purpose-designed intra-nanobodies to probe the nanoscale organization of endogenous proteins. Two specific nanobodies developed against the endogenous β2 adrenoreceptor, Nb80 and Nb37, were used to track endogenous receptors either in their active or inactive states.
  <br>  <br>  Fluorescent intra-body Localization Microscopy (FiLM), therefore enables GFP-tagged constructs to be localized by super-resolution microscopy, avoiding cloning and reagent requirements for existing in vitro or in vivo models.  This technique can also be extended to identify the diffusional signature and nanoscale organization of endogenous proteins by expressing selective purpose-designed intra-nanobodies.

    Catestatin plays crucial roles in ischemic preconditioning-induced cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury.
</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse65">
Macrophages (MΦs), one of the cells of the innate immune system, reside in or infiltrate metabolic organs under obese conditions and contribute to low-grade inflammation that impairs insulin action, leading to the development of insulin resistance.  MΦs play crucial roles in hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance as supported by improvement in insulin sensitivity after chemical deletion or genetic impairment of hepatic MΦs. Here, we have investigated the role of chromogranin A (CgA) peptide catestatin (CST) in regulation of MΦ function and the consequent improvement in insulin action.
  The activation of resident Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte (Mc)-derived recruited macrophages (McMΦs) in the liver contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. FACS-sorted F4/80+Ly6C- cells (representing KCs) and F4/80-Ly6C+ cells (representing McMΦs) revealed increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio in McMΦs compared to KCs. Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice treated with catestatin (CST) inhibited the infiltration of McMΦs, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes in MΦs, resulting in improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance in DIO mice. Systemic CST knockout (CST-KO) mice on normal chow diet (NCD) ate more food, gained weight, and displayed elevated blood glucose and insulin levels. Supplementation of CST normalized glucose and insulin levels. In order to verify that CST deficiency caused macrophages to be very pro-inflammatory in CST-KO mice (even being under NCD) and produced glucose intolerance, we tested the effects of MΦs on hepatic glucose production (HGP). Both basal and glucagon-induced HGP was markedly increased in hepatocytes co-cultured with KCs and McMΦs from NCD-fed CST-KO mice, and the effect was abrogated upon pre-treatment of CST-KO-MΦs with CST.
  The above findings provide a novel mechanism of HGP suppression through CST-mediated inhibition of macrophage infiltration and function and the consequent improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity.

  Human chromogranin A gene promoter haplotypes: Differential interactions with the transcription factor c-Rel and implications for cardiometabolic disorders
</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse67">
Chromogranin A (CHGA), an acidic glycoprotein co-stored/co- secreted with catecholamines,
plays a major role in the biogenesis of dense-core secretory vesicles in diffused neuroendocrine
system. CHGA levels are elevated in several cardiovascular disease states but the underlying
mechanisms are not well established. We aimed to identify common genetic variants in the
promoter region of CHGA and to explore the mechanistic basis behind the plausible contribution
of those variants in regulating CHGA protein levels in circulation. We re-sequenced the CHGA
locus in 769 human subjects and discovered nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
promoter region: G-1106A, A-1018T, T-1014C, T-988G, G-513A, G-462A, T-415C, C-89A and
C-57T. In addition to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed among SNPs at -1014, -988, -
462 and -89 bp positions, we observed a strong LD between the A-1018T and C-57T SNPs.
Haplotype analysis across CHGA promoter discovered five major promoter haplotypes. These
haplotypes displayed differential promoter activities; specifically, haplotype 2 (containing
variant T alleles at -1018 and -57 bp positions) showed the highest promoter activity.
Computational and experimental analyses revealed the role of the transcription factor c-Rel in
activating the CHGA promoter haplotype 2 under basal and pathophysiological conditions. In
corroboration with the higher CHGA promoter activity of haplotype 2 in vitro, individuals
carrying this haplotype showed higher plasma CHGA level; haplotype 2 subjects also displayed
elevated body mass index (by ~2.4 Kg/m 2 , p=0.004), diastolic blood pressure (by ~6.0 mm Hg,
p=0.026) and plasma glucose (by ~8.0 mg/dl, p=0.001) levels as compared to the most common
haplotype (haplotype 1). Taken together, this study points towards a functional role of a common
CHGA promoter haplotype (estimated to occur in ~900 million people Worldwide) and provides
a molecular basis for enhanced expression of CHGA in haplotype 2 carriers who may be at
higher risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.

    Chromogranin A and its derived peptides: cardiac modulation and cardioprotection</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse69">
The discovery of a cardiac production of Chromogranin A (CgA) in 1990 opened a fruitful field of research whose outcome is a cardiovascular dimension for this multifunctional protein, with great relevance in cardiac physio-pathology and clinics. In the rat heart, CgA is present in atrial myoendocrine, and conduction cells. In the human ventricular myocardium, it co-localizes with Natriuretic Peptide type B. The characterization CgA-derived peptides as intracardiac modulators, carried out in our laboratory has contributed to expand the concept of the endocrine heart. We found, by ex vivo functional studies, that through the action of its amino terminal (vasostatin) and catestatin domains, CgA exerts a direct cardiodepressive, antiadrenergic and cardioprotective influence, acting as a cardiac stabilizer under normal conditions and in the presence of stress (i.e. adrenergic, endothelinergic, and ischemia/reperfusion). At the same time, through the C-terminal serpinin, CgA elicits a beta-adrenergic-like cardiostimulatory effect. Cardioprotective effects of catestatin and serpinin occur also in spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts. Pasqua et al. (2013) documented that the intracardiac CgA processing is affected by physical (heart perfusion) and/or chemical stimuli (Isoproterenol and ET-1); the full-length CgA directly affects myocardial and coronary function by NO-cGMP-PKG cascade. Very recently, catestatin was proposed as pro-vascularization agent in “NO-OPTION” patients. However, the very short half-life and the susceptibility to degradation limit its clinical application. To overcome this problem, Angotti et al (2016) protected catestatin via encapsulation within Fibronectin-coated pharmacologically active microcarriers. Under these conditions, the peptide is released in a prolonged manner and is preserved from rapid degradation, representing a promising tool for therapeutic purpose. The above data support a multifaceted role of CgA and its derived peptides in cardiovascular homeostasis. The influence elicited on the heart under physio-pathological conditions, as well as the implication in the cardiac neuroendocrine scenario, is under intense investigation.

    Chromogranin A regulation of insulin storage and secretion as well as mitochondrial dynamics</a>
    <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse71">
      Chromogranin A (CgA) is co-stored and co-released with catecholamines from dense core (DC) vesicles (DCV) in the adrenal medulla and regulates biogenesis of DCV. CgA peptide catestatin (CST), however, inhibits nicotine-induced catecholamine secretion from DCV. Here, we report that CgA and CST regulate catecholamine storage and DCV morphology in mouse adrenal medulla and rat PC12 cells, respectively.
    CgA knockout (Chga-KO) mice contain 30-40% less catecholamines in their adrenal medulla compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant with decreased catecholamines, the DCV diameter in Chga-KO mice was less (100-200 nm) than in WT mice (200-350 nm). Chga-KO mice also showed an ~47% increase in DCV/DC area ratio, implying vesicle swelling due to increased osmotically active free catecholamines. In PC12 cells, the average diameter of DCV and DC were 142.07±1.31 and 105.77±1.07 nm, respectively. The preponderant DCV and DC diameters were 100-150 nm and 50-100 nm, respectively. Treatment of PC12 cells with peptidergic transmitter PACAP (0.1 µM) for 24 hours resulted in ~47% decrease in 100-150 nm DC diameter. Co-treatment of CST and PACAP caused ~20% increase in 100-150 nm DC diameter. Stimulation of PC12 cells by nicotinic-cholinergic agonist nicotine (60 µM) resulted in ~47% decrease in 50-100 nm DC diameter. Co-treatment of CST and nicotine caused ~23% increase in 50-100 nm DC diameter. CST decreased DCV/DC area ratio by ~13% in PACAP-treated and ~31% in nicotine-treated PC12 cells.
    We conclude that CgA and CST regulate catecholamine storage and catecholamine storage granule morphology in mice and PC12 cells.

  F-actin functions in the transport and organization of organelles in chromaffin cells

</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse73">
The F-actin cortical cytoskeleton is the major structure supporting the cell shape in chromaffin cells, and, in addition to this structural function, plays an essential role in multiples aspects of the secretory process. F-actin and microtubules cooperate to transport chromaffin granules from the internal region adjacent to the nucleus to the cell periphery where accumulate to replenish the vesicle secretory reservoirs. The retention of granules in the cortical F-actin structure causes the binomial distribution of the vesicles between cortical and internal populations, and this happen also to other organelles such mitochondria.  In addition, mitochondria seem to adapt to the spaces formed by the F-actin cortical meshwork reducing its size when compared to that of the internal mitochondria.
  	Interestingly, F-actin structure is markedly different in cultured cells and the cells present in the bovine adrenal medulla.  Thus in the “native” cell the F-actin in abundant both in the cortex and internal areas whereas in cultured cells this structure accumulates in the cortical area and is almost absent in the cell interior. In consequence, organelles and some proteins distribute differently in cultured and “native” cells, and this, in turn, could affect the influence of these organelles over the secretory dynamics.

Actin cytoskeleton and Annexin A2:Essential Partners to form exocytotic sites in neuroendocrine cells</a>
<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse75">
  Calcium-regulated exocytosis results in the release of molecules such as neurotransmitters contained in secretory granules. In neuroendocrine cells, the recruitment and subsequent fusion of secretory granules at the plasma membrane occur at specific sites dedicated to exocytosis. Annexin A2 (AnxA2) was the first protein identified at exocytotic sites in chromaffin cells. AnxA2 binds two major actors of exocytosis, actin and phospholipids and mediates the formation of lipid microdomains required for the spatial organisation of fusion sites at the plasma membrane. To understand how AnxA2 promotes this membrane remodelling, the involvement of actin filaments in lipid domain organisation was investigated. Electron tomography of chromaffin cell revealed three distinct types of actin structures including a meshwork of actin filaments that paralleled the plasma membrane, but also large bundles of actin filaments connecting secretory granules to the plasma membrane and a coat of actin directly on the surface of secretory granules. The role of each of these actin structures observed at the granule docking sites remain unknown. However amperometric measurements of catecholamine release of chromaffin cells expressing  AnxA2 mutant with impaired actin filament-bundling activity showed that cortical actin bundled by AnxA2 contributes to the formation of GM1-enriched lipid microdomains involved in the the docking and fusion of secretory granule at the plasma membrane (Gabel et al., 2015).
<br><br>  Numerous phosphorylation sites are present  in the N-terminal domain of AnxA2, in particular the tyrosine 23 (Tyr23) whose phosphorylation affects the binding of AnxA2 to actin filaments and plasma membrane. We observed that nicotine stimulation triggers the phosphorylation of AnxA2 on Tyr23 at exocytotic sites. The expression of two AnxA2 mutants carrying phosphorylation deficient (Y23A) or phosphomimetic mutation (Y23E) reduced the number exocytotic sites. The expression of mutant AnxA2-Y23A inhibited the formation of lipid microdomains, whereas that of the AnxA2-Y23E affected the actin filaments associated with docked granule.
  Altogether, these results suggest that AnxA2 and the actin cytoskeleton are essential partners for granule docking and fusion and that Tyr23 phosphorylation of AnxA2 is critical for exocytosis.

  Cortactin controls the exocytotic fusion pore by a mechanism that involves remodeling of actin filaments.</a>
  <p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse77">
  Cortactin is an actin-binding protein that promotes actin polymerization in synergy with the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP. In the present work we examined the role of cortactin in the Ca2+-induced formation of actin filaments and exocytosis. With this aim we expressed in bovine chromaffin cells different cortactin domains or mutants enable to interact with proline-rich domain (PRD)-containing proteins, like  including N-WASP, or to be phosphorylated by Ca2+-dependent kinases, such as ERK1/2 or and Src. Our results show that the activation of nicotinic receptors in chromaffin cells promotes cortactin translocation to the cell cortex, where it colocalizes with actin filaments. We further found that, in association with PRD-containing proteins, cortactin contributes to the Ca2+-induced actin filament formation and to regulate fusion pore dynamics and number of exocytotic events induced by activation of nicotinic receptors. However, whereas the actions of cortactin on fusion pore dynamics depend on the availability of monomeric actin and cortactin phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and Src kinases, this actin binding protein regulates the extent of exocytosis by a mechanism independent of actin polymerization, and that is determined by its phosphorylation by ERK1/2. Together our findings point out a role for cortactin as a critical modulator of actin filament formation and exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells.

  The “casting net” hypothesis: vesicular capture, translocation to the plasma membrane and consequences on the nanoscale organization of fusion sites
</a>

<p class="collapse collapse1" id="collapse79">
In this presentation, I will examine the role of the cortical actin network in the final
steps leading secretory vesicles to dock and fuse with the plasma membrane of
neurosecretory cells thereby releasing neurotransmitter and hormones. Following an
active transport to the periphery of the cell, secretory vesicles are recruited in a Ca 2+ -
dependent manner to the cortical actin network via the anchoring action of Myosin VI
short insert (1). Upon stimulation, the cortical actin network undergoes a Myosin II-
dependent relaxation that culminate in pulling bound secretory vesicles towards the
plasma membrane (2). The analogy of the cortical actin network acting as a casting
net dragging vesicles toward the plasma membrane provides a plausible hypothesis
to explain the synchronous translocation of secretory vesicles occurring upon
secretagogue stimulation. I will also discuss the consequences of the cortical actin
network approaching the plasma membrane on the nanoscale organization and
mobility of key proteins of the exocytic machinery (3, 4).
